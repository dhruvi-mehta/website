			<p>Hi! My name is Dhruvi. I am currently a sophmore. I am majoring in Communication Design. I initially started of with wanting to major in Integrated Design and then ended switching to Communication Design. I am excited to explore and learn more about coding, and developing my skills in leaning new languages. I am very interested in the topic of sustainability and sustainable design. I am also interested in package design and motion graphics. I was born in India but I have grown up in Singapore. I moved to Singapore when I was five, and have lived there for fifteen years now. I am excited to spend the next few years in New York City at Parsons.</p>
